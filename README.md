# Skip-Bo
A graphical java implementation of Skip-Bo game. It has been created as an exersice for the Java curriculum at the ICSD department of Aegean University. This implementation of the SkipBo game has 3 SkipBo cards, the classic one, the super one and the eraser. The Super can be used like the classic one but if the building pile is empty the player can set the card to be whatever number he wants to. On the other hand the eraser, if building pile has at least one card it erase whole pile and remove all the cards from it. If building pile is empty then eraser act like 1.

## Rules
Pointing system is simple. The game ends if the 1 player empty his stock pile or there are no more cards on the draw pile. Winner get 50 points as a bonus and points based on the remaining cards of the opponent minus his remaining cards if any.

Belove there is a representation of all class and it's relationship in the game.
