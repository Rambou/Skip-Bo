# Skip-Bo
A graphical java implementation of Skip-Bo game. It has been created as an exersice for the Java curriculum at the ICSD department of Aegean University. This implementation of the SkipBo game has 3 SkipBo cards, the classic one, the super one and the eraser. The Super can be used like the classic one but if the building pile is empty the player can set the card to be whatever number he wants to. On the other hand the eraser just erase any building pile and remove all the cards from it. 

Belove there is a representation of all class and it's relationship in the game.
